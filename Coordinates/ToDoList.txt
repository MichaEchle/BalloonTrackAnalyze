Architectural Changes to be made:
- Competition
	- Name
	- Pilot mapping
	- Altitude source (GPS or barometric)
	- Default altitude if non declared
	- Separation altitude
	- Flights (no singletons)
		- Date and Date of Day (AM/PM)
		- Flight number
		- Launch point (estimate from track or given CLP)
		- Start period
		- All goals (fixed or declared)
		- Checks (e.g. ILP to all goals, dangerous flying)
			- Penalties
				- Calculation method
				- Referred rule
				- Common naming
		- Tasks
			- Task number
			- Checks (e.g. min distance declaration to declared goal)
				- Penalties
					- Calculation method
					- Referred rule
					- Common naming
			- Scoring period
			- Result calculation
		- Reporting
			- Results
			- Scores
			- Penalties
			- Checks
			- Comments from result calculation and checks
			- git commit
	- PZs
		- Based on 3D shape
		- PZ type
			- Red
			- Yellow
			- Blue
		- Is active
		- Check if track is within PZ
			- Return yes/no, track points in PZ, time in PZ and penalty points


Branching strategy:
- Master (stable / tested branch)
- Develop (stable / untested)
- Feature branches (use while adding general features e.g. PZ, Scoring, Reporting) (potentially unstable)
- Competition branches (use for each competition, allows for competition specific changes) (potentially unstable)

Features to be added:
- Estimate Launch and Landing Position (done but needs improvement)
- Creating Picking Tool to let user selected specific markers, declarations etc from all tracks and put into one file
- Create easy to read report with information about result calculation
- Create PZ checking (done some ground work, like defining shapes including methods to calculate the distance within the shape)
- Add more types of tasks
- Add more type of checks and penalties
- Documentation
- Checklist what and when to setup
- Add Unit and Integration tests
	- Add .igc files for testing

Testing:
- Calculate scores from results (done needs further testing)
- Added and / or rule that allows chaining of rules, needs testing
- Dangerous Flying 8+/- m/s for 5 consecutive seconds (done needs testing)
